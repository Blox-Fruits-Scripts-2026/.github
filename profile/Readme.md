## Project Overview

Blox Fruits is Roblox's premier One Piece-inspired adventure (Game ID: 2753915549), with millions grinding seas for fruits, levels, and PvP glory. This repository elevates your game: from beginner auto-farms to pro-level tools like automated Race V4 trials and Mirage hunting. We focus on keyless scripts (no ads/whitelists), compatibility with latest 2026 updates (new fruits, Sea 3 revamps, anti-exploit systems), and community-driven evolution.

As a full-scale project, we include not just scripts but guides, tips, and plans for future expansions (e.g., mobile support, custom script builder). All code is open-source under MIT license — fork, modify, contribute!

## Core Features

This project covers every aspect of Blox Fruits automation. Here's a deep dive:

- **Auto Farm Suite**: Grind levels, mastery, stats, and beli 24/7. Customizable for Sea 1–3 mobs, bosses, or islands. Includes anti-AFK to run overnight.
- **Devil Fruit Mastery**: Sniper auto-grabs rare fruits (Mythical/Legendary), teleport to spawns, storage dupe, and notifier for new drops.
- **Raid & Boss Automation**: Loop Kitsune/Dough King raids, auto-join/leave, boss farms (e.g., Rip Indra, Tide Keeper) with godmode.
- **Combat & PvP Tools**: Godmode/infinite health, auto-dodge, super speed/jump, ESP players (health, distance, fruits equipped), bounty hunter teleports.
- **Exploration Hacks**: Fly/noclip for fast travel, teleport to islands/players/custom coords, Mirage finder, Sea Beast auto-farm.
- **Economy Boosts**: Infinite Beli/Money dupe, auto-sell fruits/items, chest ESP/auto-collect.
- **Progression Unlocks**: Race V4 auto-trials/awakenings, fighting style V2, sword/gun mastery farms.
- **Extras**: Anti-ban bypass, invisible mode, troll features (fling players, spam fruits), GUI customizations (neon themes).

All features are toggleable via clean GUIs, with low-lag optimizations for long sessions.

## Advanced Usage Guide

Maximize your scripts with these pro tips:

1. **Optimal Auto Farm Setup**: Use Redz Hub on Sea 3 for fastest mastery. Set "Safe Mode" ON to teleport away from players. Combine with Anti-AFK for 8+ hour sessions — gain 500+ levels overnight.
2. **Fruit Sniper Strategy**: In HoHo Hub, enable "Fruit Notifier" + "Auto Teleport". Focus on Mythical fruits like Dragon/Kitsune — script scans servers for spawns every 10s.
3. **Raid Farming Pro**: Vortex for raids — auto-equip best fruits, godmode through bosses, collect fragments automatically. Tip: Join empty servers via teleport for 100% success rate.
4. **PvP Dominance**: Enable ESP + Godmode in ThunderZ. Use "Auto Dodge" for combos, "Bounty Teleport" to hunt high-bounty players. Avoid public servers to minimize reports.
5. **Customization**: Most hubs allow GUI themes (dark/neon). Edit loadstrings for personal tweaks (e.g., add custom teleports).
6. **Safety Tips**: Always use VPN + alt accounts. If detected, switch executors. Project includes anti-ban modules updated monthly.
